//! Traits to aid the correct use of buffers in DMA abstractions.
//!
//! This library provides the [`ReadBuffer`] and [`WriteBuffer`] unsafe traits to be used as bounds to
//! buffers types used in DMA operations.
//!
//! There are some subtleties to the extent of the guarantees provided by these traits, all of these
//! subtleties are properly documented in the safety requirements in this crate. However, as a
//! measure of redundancy, some are listed below:
//!
//! * The traits only guarantee a stable location while no `&mut self` methods are called upon
//! `Self` (with the exception of [`write_buffer`](trait.WriteBuffer.html#tymethod.write_buffer) in
//! our case). This is to allow types like `Vec`, this restriction doesn't apply to `Self::Target`.
//!
//! * [`ReadBuffer`] and [`WriteBuffer`] guarantee a stable location for as long as the DMA transfer
//! occurs. Given the intrinsics of `mem::forget` and the Rust language itself, a
//! 'static lifetime is usually required.
//!
//! The above list is not exhaustive, for a complete set of requirements and guarantees, the
//! documentation of each trait and method should be analyzed.
